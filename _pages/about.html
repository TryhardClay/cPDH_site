            <h2>Origins of the DDB</h2>
            <p> The Competitive Pauper Commander Decklist Database began in 2021 as a means to gain a broader community insight on what was considered "competitive" at the time.
              Other efforts within the community attempted to leverage the singular expertise of a few select individuals - and that didn't seem quite right.</p>
             <p>So, Clay reached out to a number of other brewers within the community in an effort to develop a strategy meant to establish the tone of community consensus moving forward. <b>And the Google Spreadsheet DDB was born!</b>
              From there, we established a relationship with Timmyt1000™ and BudgetBrews.club, stood up the first DDB Selection Committee, and the rest was history.</p>
            <p>Now, the cPDH Decklist Database is a volunteer-led compendium of player submitted decks. And those decks listed must adhere to a small list of minimum requirements which seek to 
              standardize their information for public consumption.</p>
          <br />
            <h2>Origins of cPDH.guide</h2>
            <p>After about a year of community-based analysis on competitive archetypes, commander and color viability, etc., we still felt like we were missing something - something critical.
              By that point, we had heavily discussed (and speculated) on the effects of various archetypes on the larger meta, but we had no real way of proving those claims.</p>
            <p>Thus, in May 2022, we were the first to make publicly available all of our gameplay data from games played within the Tryhards Community - and it exploded from there. For the first time ever,
              brewers were incorporating meta trends and analysis into the construction of their decks, in real time. It was such a boon to the meta, we wanted to more widely distrubute the data in an effort to
              assist the cPDH Community, at large.
